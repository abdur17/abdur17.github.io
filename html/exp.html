                    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                    <p>When it comes to <i>work experience</i> for me there isn't
                        really much for me to say other than the fact that i don't have any.
                        But as time progresses into the future, I hope to gain some
                        experience by then.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Skills that I'm experienced in</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Programming - due to my time pursuing Computer Science I've learnt how to program in languages like C and others.</li>
                        <li>Repairing/Maintaining computer hardware - I like to get my hands down on the hardware whenever something goes wrong. It is always best when you do it yourself, though it is not always the case.</li>
                        <li>Building circuits - Building and thinkering with circuits is often quite fun for me. Once there's a soldering iron, some components and a schematic diagram, there's no stopping me.</li>
                        <li>Using the command line interface - The interface some people despise. I'm not a full blown command line user but using it gives me the ability to unlock the full potential of the OS and grants me access over <strong>EVERYTHING</strong> in the file system.</li>
                    </ul>
